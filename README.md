# Introduction
This new word generation project is used to generate the new word with the given two different words from the user and this application script uses the streamlit, that is an open-source app framework for Machine Learning and Data Science. In order to run it, you have to change the constants.py file and change it with the Open AI API key â€ . (Unfortunately, OpenAI blocks your keys when they are shared online, so mine wont work and you have to put yours).
